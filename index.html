          The story Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran
          away. That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate.
          They said, “We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is
          most unfortunate.” The farmer said, “Maybe.” The next day the horse
          came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening
          everybody came back and said, “Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn
          of events. You now have eight horses!” The farmer again said, “Maybe.”
          The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while
          riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg. The neighbors then said,
          “Oh dear, that’s too bad,” and the farmer responded, “Maybe.” The next
          day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the
          army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg. Again all
          the neighbors came around and said, “Isn’t that great!” Again, he
          said, “Maybe.” The whole process of nature is an integrated process of
          immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell whether
          anything that happens in it is good or bad — because you never know
          what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know
          what will be the consequences of good fortune.

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>
          Good and Bad are just one perspective. Bananas are good for monkeys,
          but monkeys are not good for bananas. Let's not make a big deal out of
          it...
