          The story Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran
          away. That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate.
          They said, “We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is
          most unfortunate.” The farmer said, “<b>Maybe.</b>” The next day the
          horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening
          everybody came back and said, “Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn
          of events. You now have eight horses!” The farmer again said,
          “<b>Maybe.</b>” The following day his son tried to break one of the
          horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg. The
          neighbors then said, “Oh dear, that’s too bad,” and the farmer
          responded, “<b>Maybe.</b>” The next day the conscription officers came
          around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son
          because he had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and
          said, “Isn’t that great!” Again, he said, “<b>Maybe.</b>” The whole
          process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and
          it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is
          good or bad — because you never know what will be the consequence of
          the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of
          good fortune.

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>
          Good and Bad are just one perspective. Bananas are good for monkeys,
          but monkeys are not good for bananas. Let's not make a big deal out of
          it...
