          The story Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran
          away. That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate.
          They said,
          <q
            >We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most
            unfortunate.</q
          >
          The farmer said, <q><b>Maybe.</b></q>
          <img
            class="right"
            src="./img/story.jpg"
            alt=""
            width="400px"
            height="200px"
          />
        </p>
        <p>
          The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it,
          and in the evening everybody came back and said, ,<q
            >Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have
            eight horses!</q
          >
          The farmer again said, <q><b>Maybe.</b></q>
        </p>
        <p>
          The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while
          riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg. The neighbors then said,
          <q>Oh dear, that’s too <span class="bad">bad</span>,</q> and the
          farmer responded, <q><b>Maybe.</b></q>
          <img
            class="left"
            src="./img/storyv2.jpg"
            alt=""
            width="400px"
            height="200px"
          />
        </p>

        <p>
          The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people
          into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg.
          Again all the neighbors came around and said,
          <q>Isn’t that great!</q> Again, he said, <q><b>Maybe.</b></q>
        </p>

        <p>
          The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense
          complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that
          happens in it is <span class="good">good</span> or
          <span class="bad">bad</span> — because you never know what will be the
          consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the
          consequences of <span class="good">good</span> fortune.

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>
          <span class="good">Good</span> and <span class="bad">Bad</span> are
          just one perspective. Bananas are <span class="good">good</span> for
          monkeys, but monkeys are not <span class="good">good</span> for
          bananas. Let's not make a big deal out of it...
